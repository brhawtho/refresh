# Refresh

## Motivation
This project started following the mentality of the Momentum chrome extension. I started to get sick of my old desktop backgrounds, so I decided it was time for a change.

## Time to Change
As I started to use Momentum more and more, I started to realize how seeing a nice picture could really change your mood for the day. Rather than being stuck with the "same old, same old" you could see a beautiful photo. I started to grab some of these photos from Momentum, saving them and setting them on rotation as my desktop background. I figured this would keep me away from getting bored of beautiful photos.

This project is the next step.

## What is Refresh
In the end, I hope this repo will store all of my favorite images that work as desktop photos. I hope to eventually set an alias on my .bash_profile such that I can type 'refresh', and my background will switch to a randomized photo from this repo.

## Credit
For now, all credit for these images goes to the Momentum team, and the respective owners. I'm just adding them to this directory so I can work with them a bit easier! Updates to come.
